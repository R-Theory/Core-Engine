# Plugin System + Document Engine Implementation Plan

## Purpose of This Document

This implementation plan details the development of a modular plugin system combined with a document processing engine for the Core Engine platform. The plan serves as a roadmap for building extensible, non-interfering architecture that enables incremental feature development while maintaining system stability and modularity.

---

## Final Goal & Vision

### Core Vision
Create a **modular plugin architecture** that enables the Core Engine to:
- Process any document type through pluggable parsers
- Store content using swappable storage backends (with Notion as primary backend)
- Extend functionality without interfering with existing systems
- Support the long-term vision of Notion-as-backend with intelligent frontend interface

### Key Principles
- **Non-interfering**: Plugins work independently, system functions without them
- **Extensible**: New capabilities can be added without touching core code
- **Modular**: Each component is swappable and optional
- **Foundation-first**: Sets up infrastructure for future AI and graph features

---

## Success Criteria

### User Perspective Success
- ✅ **Simple Upload**: Drag & drop any file, it "just works"
- ✅ **Universal Search**: Find content across all uploaded documents
- ✅ **Notion Integration**: Documents automatically sync to Notion as pages/database entries
- ✅ **Plugin Management**: Easy enable/disable of features through UI
- ✅ **No Workflow Disruption**: Existing features continue working unchanged

### Frontend Success
- ✅ **Plugin Management UI**: Visual interface for enabling/configuring plugins
- ✅ **Document Upload Interface**: Drag & drop with progress indicators
- ✅ **Search Interface**: Unified search across all processed content
- ✅ **Settings Integration**: Plugin configuration within existing settings system
- ✅ **Non-blocking UI**: File processing happens in background

### Backend Success
- ✅ **Plugin System**: Clean interfaces for parsers, processors, and storage
- ✅ **Document Engine**: Robust file processing with error handling
- ✅ **Notion Storage Plugin**: Full integration with Notion API for content storage
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for document operations and plugin management
- ✅ **Extensibility**: New plugins can be added without core changes

## Technical Architecture

### Plugin System Design
```python
# Core Interface
class Plugin(ABC):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str: pass
    
    @property
    def capabilities(self) -> List[str]: pass
    
    async def initialize(self, config: dict) -> bool: pass
    
    async def process(self, data: Any) -> Any: pass

# Specialized Interfaces  
class StoragePlugin(Plugin):
    async def store(self, document: Document) -> str: pass
    async def retrieve(self, document_id: str) -> Document: pass

class ParserPlugin(Plugin):
    async def can_parse(self, file_path: str) -> bool: pass
    async def parse(self, file_path: str) -> Document: pass
```

### Document Processing Flow
```
1. File Upload → 2. Type Detection → 3. Parser Selection
       ↓                ↓                    ↓
4. Content Extraction → 5. Metadata Processing → 6. Storage
       ↓                      ↓                     ↓
7. Indexing → 8. Notification → 9. Cleanup
```

### Storage Strategy
- **Primary**: Notion pages/databases for structured content
- **Metadata**: PostgreSQL for search indexes and relationships  
- **Files**: Local storage with optional cloud backup
- **Cache**: Redis for frequently accessed content

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Notion API Rate Limits**: Implement queuing and batching
- **Large File Memory Usage**: Stream processing and chunking
- **Plugin Conflicts**: Priority system and error isolation
- **File Processing Failures**: Graceful fallbacks and retry logic

### User Experience Risks
- **Slow Upload Experience**: Background processing with progress indicators
- **Search Performance**: Indexed search with caching
- **Plugin Complexity**: Simple on/off toggles with sane defaults

### Integration Risks
- **Breaking Existing Features**: Thorough testing and feature flags
- **Notion Account Dependencies**: Fallback to local storage
- **Plugin Dependencies**: Optional plugin loading with error handling
